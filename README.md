RISE, available on both iOS and Android, is a portfolio application designed to assist high school students in planning their futures, from college applications to resume development and beyond. Created for the FBLA Mobile Application 2023-2024 event, RISE enables students to create a personalized portfolio showcasing their high school experiences, including athletics, art, clubs, community service, classes, awards, and more.

The app features a sleek, intuitive UI and leverages Firebase for robust database and authentication services. Users can create aesthetic, professional resumes to represent their experiences, which can be printed or shared on social media. Integration with various LinkedIn APIs, from creating posts to exporting experiences to LinkedIn profiles, further streamlines the process of connecting students with future opportunities.

Prioritizing safety and privacy, RISE collects minimal personal information and adheres to best security practices, using data solely for app functionality. To foster personal vision and goal-setting habits, the app includes unique goals and analytics tools based on research-backed methods, helping students set and track their goals effectively.
