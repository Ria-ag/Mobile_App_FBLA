# RISE 

By Jishnu Mehta, Ria Agarwal  
Woodinville High School  
Woodinville, WA


RISE, available on both iOS and Android, is catered to assisting high school students with planning their future, from college applications to resume development and beyond. The app was created for the FBLA Mobile Application 2023-2024 event and enables students to create a personalized portfolio to display all of their high school experiences, including athletics, performing arts, clubs and organizations, community service hours, honors classes, tests, awards, and projects. Furthermore, these experiences can be converted to a file to print or share with others through social media. The app takes in very limited personal information and only stores data locally, making it a safe app for high schoolers. To foster a personal vision and goal-setting habits, the app also contains unique goals and analytics features, using research-backed methods to help them set and track goals.
